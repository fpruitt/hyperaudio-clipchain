hyperaudio-clipchain
==============

A module designed to create transcript search functionality in a Hyperaudio Pad-like environment.

To test out this site's functionality, pull this repository and place it into your web server root. Navigate to it in your web browser. Choose the videos you wish to search in the sidebar to the left, and enter your search text in the text box. Choose 'Search'. The words that you found should appear in the staging area to the right. You can now play these words together as individual clips.

This project is very much still in development. If you are interested in contributing, get in touch with the Hyperaudio Team at hyperaud.io. 

This project was worked on by Forrest Pruitt, Paul Muren, Nate Reisinger, and Brad Little as a Senior Capstone at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. This project was supported by Mark Boas, Dan Schultz, and the rest of the HyperAudio team.
